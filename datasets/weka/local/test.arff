analysis,'IN the beginning, the technology gods created the Internet and saw that it was good. Here, at last, was a public sphere with unlimited potential for reasoned debate and the thoughtful exchange of ideas, an enlightening conversational bridge across the many geographic, social, cultural, ideological and economic boundaries that ordinarily separate us in life, a way to pay bills without a stamp.'
analysis,'The Web, it should be said, is still a marvelous place for public debate. But when it comes to reading and understanding news stories online — like this one, for example — the medium can have a surprisingly potent effect on the message. Comments from some readers, our research shows, can significantly distort what other readers think was reported in the first place.'
analysis,'In a study published online last month in The Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, we and three colleagues report on an experiment designed to measure what one might call “the nasty effect.”'
analysis,'We asked 1,183 participants to carefully read a news post on a fictitious blog, explaining the potential risks and benefits of a new technology product called nanosilver. These infinitesimal silver particles, tinier than 100-billionths of a meter in any dimension, have several potential benefits (like antibacterial properties) and risks (like water contamination), the online article reported.'
analysis,'Then we had participants read comments on the post, supposedly from other readers, and respond to questions regarding the content of the article itself.'
analysis,'Half of our sample was exposed to civil reader comments and the other half to rude ones — though the actual content, length and intensity of the comments, which varied from being supportive of the new technology to being wary of the risks, were consistent across both groups. The only difference was that the rude ones contained epithets or curse words, as in: “If you don’t see the benefits of using nanotechnology in these kinds of products, you’re an idiot” and “You’re stupid if you’re not thinking of the risks for the fish and other plants and animals in water tainted with silver.”'
analysis,'The results were both surprising and disturbing. Uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant’s interpretation of the news story itself.'
analysis,'In the civil group, those who initially did or did not support the technology — whom we identified with preliminary survey questions — continued to feel the same way after reading the comments. Those exposed to rude comments, however, ended up with a much more polarized understanding of the risks connected with the technology.'
analysis,'Simply including an ad hominem attack in a reader comment was enough to make study participants think the downside of the reported technology was greater than they’d previously thought.'
analysis,'While it’s hard to quantify the distortional effects of such online nastiness, it’s bound to be quite substantial, particularly — and perhaps ironically — in the area of science news.'
analysis,'An estimated 60 percent of the Americans seeking information about specific scientific matters say the Internet is their primary source of information —  ranking it higher than any other news source.'
analysis,'Our emerging online media landscape has created a new public forum without the traditional social norms and self-regulation that typically govern our in-person exchanges — and that medium, increasingly, shapes both what we know and what we think we know.'
analysis,'One possible approach to moderate the nasty effect, of course, is to shut down online reader comments altogether, as some media organizations and bloggers have done. Paul Krugman’s blog post on this newspaper’s Web site on the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, for instance, simply ended with “I’m not going to allow comments on this post, for obvious reasons.”'
analysis,'But as they say, the genie is out of the bottle. Reader interaction is part of what makes the Web the Web — and, for that matter, Facebook, Twitter and every other social media platform what they are. This phenomenon will only gain momentum as we move deeper into a world of smart TVs and mobile devices where any type of content is immediately embedded in a constant stream of social context and commentary.'
analysis,'It’s possible that the social norms in this brave new domain will change once more — with users shunning meanspirited attacks from posters hiding behind pseudonyms and cultivating civil debate instead.'

facts,'Obama, Putin Talk, But Ukraine Standoff Deepens'
facts,'Comments'
facts,'The United States and European allies appeared no closer to resolving a worsening crisis in Ukraine on Monday, despite another in a series of conversations between President Obama and Vladimir Putin.'
facts,'Obama told Putin that forces in Ukraine backed by Moscow “need to lay down their arms” and he urged the Russia n leader to use his influence over armed, pro-Russian groups to get them to “depart the buildings” they seized in Ukraine. The president repeated his call to Putin to pull back up to 40,000 troops, tanks and supplies from the border, where NATO has documented what appears to be a strengthening force preparing for invasion.'
facts,'The Kremlin -- which described the call between the two leaders hours before the White House released its description at 7:28 p.m. Eastern time -- pointed to April 17 talks in Geneva as the next formal step in a months-long standoff that has seen the annexation by Moscow of Crimea and the deployment of menacing forces along Ukraine’s eastern border.'
facts,'The United States, the European Union, Ukraine and Russia are expected to undertake formal discussions Thursday in Geneva, five weeks before May 25 elections are to take place in Ukraine.'
facts,'Ukrainian officials have been warning that the Kremlin seeks to disrupt the four-party talks before they begin.'
facts,'Obama, searching for a united front in Europe as tensions mount, also spoke Monday with French President Francois Hollande, following a discussion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week. Obama and Hollande re-emphasized that Russia faces “significant additional costs if it continues this behavior,” the White House said in a statement, offering no specifics about what sort of Russian provocations would trigger new economic sanctions, or what form such sanctions would take.'
facts,'To date, Putin has ignored calls by Obama and Merkel to withdraw troops from the border, and shrugged off travel and financial sanctions imposed against individual Russians as well as threats by the United States and Europe to squeeze his nation’s lucrative petroleum sector as an economic punishment. So far, heads of state in Europe have resisted cutting off Russia as a major energy supplier because of the pain it would cause at home.'
facts,'The Obama administration has accused Moscow of orchestrating unrest within Ukraine using paid and armed protesters to increase street violence and turmoil. Obama has commended Ukraine’s leaders for exercising restraint under pressure, and said the United States is considering all but direct military intervention to provide assistance.'
facts,'CIA Director John Brennan was in Kiev over the weekend, the White House confirmed. And Vice President Biden will travel to Kiev next week. A U.S. loan guarantee package for Ukraine worth at least $1 billion was completed Monday, the Treasury Department reported.'
facts,'Stirring more unrest inside Ukraine is viewed in the West as a Putin ploy to woo Russian-speaking Ukrainians to reject European-style democracy and accept Moscow’s protections. Some protesters in eastern Ukraine are calling for a referendum on autonomy -- a situation Putin has helped choreograph.'
facts,'“Vladimir Putin called upon Barack Obama to use the American side’s capabilities to prevent the use of force and bloodshed as much as possible,” the Kremlin said in its statement Monday.'
facts,'Putin rejected Obama’s assertions that Moscow is deliberately “meddling” in southeastern Ukraine, telling the U.S. president that such claims are “inaccurate.” Putin placed blame elsewhere, saying the unrest is “the result of the Kiev authorities’ unwillingness and inability to take into account the interests of the Russian and Russian-speaking population.”'
facts,'“The current Ukrainian authorities must think first and foremost about truly involving all the main political forces and regions in a transparent process for developing a new constitution that guarantees the main rights and freedoms for citizens, the nation’s federal structure and its non-aligned status,” the Kremlin continued.'
facts,'The White House echoed a Pentagon rebuke, saying Moscow was “provocative and unprofessional” over the weekend in dispatching a warplane that made up to a dozen close passes over a U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer in the Black Sea.'
facts,'White House spokesman Jay Carney said Russia posed a threat to Ukraine, was intentionally provoking rather than de-escalating a crisis, and would face “more costs” for its actions.'
facts,'The White House continued to rule out deployment of U.S. forces to protect Ukraine. “There is no military solution to this crisis,” Carney repeated.'
facts,'Over the weekend, Sen. John McCain said the United States should provide Ukraine with light weapons and military assistance, reinforced with severe economic sanctions against Russia to prevent regional destabilization by the Putin government.'
facts,'"Right now hes going full speed ahead down the freeway. And theres no tangible evidence of him having to pay a significant penalty," McCain told CBS News. "Where is the president of the United States? Shouldnt the president of the United States be speaking forcefully and strongly? And didnt the president say if they carried out further actions, there would be further sanctions? So far, we havent heard anything."'
facts,'Obama last spoke with Putin when the Russian president called him March 28 and the two discussed what the White House called a U.S. proposal to find a negotiated end to the clash over Ukraine. A meeting in Paris between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov immediately after that call failed to resolve disagreements.'

facts,'Poll: Low Grades for Obama on Foreign Policy'
facts,'Comments'
facts,'As the U.S. relationship with Russia has deteriorated, President Obama is earning some of his lowest foreign policy approval ratings ever, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll . And with 56 percent of survey respondents believing that the situation in Ukraine could “lead to a renewal of the Cold War,” less than half of them consider Vladimir Putin “mentally stable.”'
facts,'Americans are split as to whether Obama is a stronger leader than the Russian president, 42 percent-42 percent. Overall, however, just 39 percent of respondents approve of Obama’s foreign policy, and 55 percent disapprove. That runs slightly below his overall job approval, which stands at 42 percent-50 percent.'
facts,'Eighty percent of those polled are concerned that the situation in Ukraine could lead to a larger regional conflict involving the U.S. military, but the crisis has prompted a slew of “mixed signals” from voters, according to the survey report. Only 41 percent approve of Obama’s handling of Ukraine and Russia. Yet, 45 percent say that his handling has been “about right.” And while respondents support economic sanctions against Russia by 69 percent-21 percent, more than half say the country should not get too involved.'
facts,'While most Americans reject the comparison of Putin to Adolf Hitler, 80 percent believe he is not trustworthy (though most Americans believe Putin is a strong leader).'
facts,'“Is the old Cold War Bear lurking in Ukraine? Americans express concern but caution on how to handle Russia,” said Quinnipiac University Poll Assistant Director Tim Malloy.'
facts,'The nationwide survey of 1,578 registered voters was conducted March 26-31 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. '

analysis,'April 15 ought to be one of the calendar’s happiest days, particularly after a long and brutal winter. Instead it makes many Americans long for a day in January.'
analysis,'Families are forced into the annual ritual of rounding up receipts and records so they can (a) tackle the 74,000-page tax code on their own, (b) deduct (c) from (b) or (b) from (a), which ever is greater, and find a reliable accountant to do it for them. It wasn’t always so.'
analysis,'A hundred years ago, the income tax was a simple, four-page document, written in straightforward English. The income tax was levied at the rate of 3 percent of incomes exceeding $800, which exempted almost all wage earners.'
analysis,'A century of prosperity, bureaucratic tinkering and crony provisions later, special-interest breaks and class warfare have created the mess we have today. Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute observes that the tax code doesn’t even define something as basic as income.'
analysis,'There are 1,200 separate IRS forms and schedules to fill out, each with its own instruction sheet. There’s Form 211 to apply for a “reward for original information.” Form 706-CE certifies payment of a foreign death tax. There’s Form 13424-B “Low Income Taxpayer Clinic (LITC) Interim and Year-End Report Controversy Issues.”'
analysis,'Entire forests are consumed annually to support this madness because tax policy is the fastest way to impose “social change.” The tax man has created a credit for electric vehicles and a tax on “gas guzzlers.”'
analysis,'Each intervention has unintended consequences. Innocent breaks such as the mortgage deduction, which is meant to encourage homeownership, becomes a subsidy for high-income homeowners in expensive metropolitan areas.'
analysis,'The expanding crazy quilt of exemptions makes it ever more difficult and expensive to figure out how to stay on the right side of the law. A study by Mercatus Center scholars Jason Fichtner and Jacob Feldman finds that Americans devote 6 billion hours to complying with the tax code, which is the equivalent of an annual output by a workforce of 3.4 million people. That’s enough to staff Wal-Mart, Target, IBM and McDonald’s, four of the largest American companies.'
analysis,'The tax code brings in $2.5 trillion for Uncle Sam, but the system’s unseen costs are as much as $987 billion. A trillion here and a trillion there, and soon we’re talking about real money, even in Washington.'
analysis,'The Earned Income Tax Credit was started with the laudable goal of lending poor families a helping hand without reducing the incentive to work. Now it’s one of the most abused programs, with the Office of Budget and Management estimating that almost 23 cents of every dollar are paid out improperly in this rapidly expanding program.'
analysis,'The corporate tax code sends the wrong message to American businesses. The United States has the highest corporate-tax rate in the developed world, a system of global taxation and we allow deduction of interest on debt. This encourages companies to move elsewhere, and those that stay can load up on debt and engage in risky behavior. Firms with more assets and income, such as Caterpillar, leave the country.'
analysis,'The availability of deductions and credits increases the incentive to lobby Congress for more. Mercatus estimates that the cost of these tax provisions could be as high as $609 billion.'
analysis,'Other nations have figured out where we went wrong. Estonia successfully embraced a flat tax. Canada cut its corporate income taxes and fared better in the recent economic downturn than most other nations. Comprehensive reform would produce an equitable, transparent, simple and predictable system that treats everyone the same. That would make April 15 a fine spring day in any year.'Services'
analysis,'Do you think the federal agents seizing and then releasing cattle last week from the Bundy ranch in Nevada will create a political headache for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid?'
analysis,'View results'
analysis,'America is a tolerant and expansive nation, having taught the world that a variety of beliefs and lifestyles can thrive across a diverse and prosperous fruited plain. It’s also a nation where tolerant folk are frequently called on to tolerate the intolerant, the price we pay for the right to speak freely. But the abusers of tolerance must be called to account.'
analysis,'Apologists for certain primitive practices of the Islamic faith have recently demonstrated the power of intolerance. They cowed Brandeis University to withdraw an honorary degree for Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an outspoken critic of mistreatment of women and abuse of little girls in the name of Islam. Ms. Hirsi Ali , who fled her Muslim-dominated native Somalia, is the object of worldwide attention for her criticism of female genital mutilation, forced marriage and other barbaric practices common and commonly defended in the Islamic world.'
analysis,'This should have been a good teaching moment for Brandeis , but the teachers took a holiday. On April 8, President Frederick Lawrence rescinded the honorary degree that would have been conferred on her at the university graduation on May 21, caving to pressure from bloggers and online petitioners who say Ms. Hirsi Ali is unduly critical of Muslim “traditions.” Said a statement in the name of the university : “We cannot overlook that certain of her past statements are inconsistent with Brandeis University ’s core values.” Some values. Some core.'
analysis,'Ms. Hirsi Ali doesn’t mince words when she lectures and writes from her position as a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. Calling her native religion “a destructive, nihilistic cult of death” isn’t meant to make friends, but to awaken the naive to the nature of Islamic excesses. Her critics on the campus and in the faculty lounge at Brandeis have likely never seen the flash of a sharp knife meant for their own private parts.'
analysis,'Similar intolerance forced Brendan Eich to resign as the CEO of Mozilla, the software company and creator of the popular Firefox Web browser. Mr. Eich made the unforgivable “mistake” of donating $1,000 to the campaign for Proposition 8, the 2008 referendum to amend the California Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He was in good company; a decisive majority of Californians approved Prop 8.'
analysis,'Detractors of Ms. Hirsi Ali and Mr. Eich beat down reason with lies. When Mark Twain observed that “a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes,” he couldn’t have imagined that in the 21st century lies travel much faster than that. Bloggers took up the campaign that started on the Brandeis campus, and intolerance “went viral.”'
analysis,'The tolerance of other views that is held a virtue in America enables bigotry a voice, too. Like opposing armies, apologists for radical Islam and homosexual privilege chip away at the forbearance and good will that made America the great melting pot, transforming “the huddled masses yearning to breathe free” into a nation and society of free men and women.'
analysis,'Do you think the federal agents seizing and then releasing cattle last week from the Bundy ranch in Nevada will create a political headache for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid?'
analysis,'View results'
analysis,'Democrats eager to enact amnesty are telling Republicans it’s not in their interests to stand in the way of comprehensive immigration reform. Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois says he wants to “to save [Republicans] from … opponents of legal immigration and immigration reform.”'
analysis,'Some Republicans may be touched that some Democrats want to share the love, but the nonpartisan Center for Immigration Studies does not agree. The Washington-based think tank issued a study Tuesday that examines what it calls “the partisan political implications of large-scale immigration,” such as what happened following the 1986 amnesty, and predicts a similar result if the “Gang of Eight” reform bill, passed by the Senate and beloved by amnesty advocates, becomes law.'
analysis,'The study, led by the University of Maryland’s James G. Gimpel, confirms the center’s 2010 findings that mass immigration takes votes away from Republicans and gives them to Democrats. “Each one percentage-point increase in the immigrant share of a large county’s population,” Mr. Gimpel concludes, “reduces the Republican share of the two-party vote by nearly 0.6 percentage points, on average.”'
analysis,'The conclusions further note that the “enormous flow” of legal immigrants into the country — 29.5 million from 1980 to 2012 — “has remade and continues to remake the nation’s electorate in favor of the Democratic Party.” It’s no coincidence that Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections, and won the sixth only narrowly. No Republican presidential nominee since 1980 has won more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. Enactment of the Gang of Eight bill “would accelerate this process.” This explains why House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is making “immigration reform” her top legislative priority and has gone on the road to push it.'
analysis,'The San Francisco Democrat suggested that if she had to choose, she’d rather see immigration reform enacted than regain the speakership. That’s pure sophistry, of course, because these options are hardly mutually exclusive. The several million immigrants who would be added to the voter rolls would guarantee her getting the gavel back, and this time for good.'
analysis,'Increased immigration reduces the Republican vote because immigrants “have policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government,” the report explains, and such preferences “are more closely aligned with [liberals] than with conservatives.” The survey data “show a two-to-one party identification with Democrats over Republicans.”'
analysis,'Adding to the nation’s low-income population through open-door immigration policies further increases the share of the electorate that supports “redistributive policies championed by Democrats.” Illegal immigration may well be, as Jeb Bush suggests, “an act of love” by migrant parents for their children, but you don’t have to be a doctor of psychology to understand why Democrats love immigration “reform” so much.'
analysis,'Kathleen Sebelius said goodbye to her colleagues at the Department of Health and Human Services at a ceremony Friday in the White House Rose Garden. She was in the midst of telling a touching story, and paused when she flipped through the pages of her prepared remarks. “Unfortunately, a page is missing,” she finally said. “So I’m just glad to have had this opportunity.” It was an appropriate send-off.'
analysis,'Mrs. Sebelius was saddled with the impossible task of making Obamacare work. It’s not like she could have done anything to make the government takeover of one of the most critical sectors of our economy a good idea. It was doomed to be a disaster from the beginning. Some people know how to suffer disaster with dignity. Wallace Hartley, the leader of the orchestra on the Titanic, realized what was happening and the futility of trying to save himself. He took out his violin and played a tune to calm passengers as the “unsinkable” ship settled into its watery grave.'
analysis,'Mrs. Sebelius could not similarly rise to her occasion. When she was called before a congressional panel to explain why the Healthcare.gov website flopped, the authentic message, in words not delivered, was simple: “The secretary was missing.” Rather than take an active role in ensuring the president’s No. 1 priority was implemented properly, she avoided planning and progress meetings. This enabled her to blame underlings, who were dispatched to meet the administration’s constantly shifting demands.'
analysis,'Mrs. Sebelius knew from the start that “if you like your insurance you can keep it” was a message of pure hogwash. Under orders from President Obama, she nevertheless played an active role in spreading that promise. The problem with basing such a major endeavor on such a whopper is that the lie is contagious. One evasion begets a fib begets a deception, and soon people notice.'
analysis,'Rep. Darrell E. Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent Mrs. Sebelius a harsh letter all but accusing her of perjury in her statements about the safety of Americans’ private information as it is entered into the Obamacare system. “Your failure,” he wrote, “during numerous congressional hearings to explicitly mention the serious problems with security testing in the month prior to launch creates the appearance that you carefully chose language that would mislead members of Congress and the American public.”'
analysis,'Sylvia Burwell, director of the Office of Management and Budget, will replace Mrs. Sebelius . She faces no easy task trying to sell the public on a product the public clearly does not want.'
analysis,'She has an opportunity now to set things right with Congress and the American people. Amends must begin with a pledge of honesty and openness. With its 76,000 employees and a budget almost the size of the entire economy of Australia, there’s no reason that this government agency can’t release accurate numbers of actual, paid Obamacare enrollees who were not previously insured.'
analysis,'The administration taints the discourse when it issues only self-serving numbers, designed to paint the program as a false positive. The new secretary should work closely with Congress, opening up documents and inviting discussion on how to improve the law.'
analysis,'The most useful change of all would be for the new secretary to respect her oath to uphold the Constitution, which means changes to the law must be approved by the House and Senate and signed by the president, no matter how insistent Mr. Obama might be in telling her otherwise.'
analysis,'Mrs. Sebelius , though sacked by the president, can console herself that her lackluster performance as a Cabinet officer won’t diminish future opportunities to make a little money. She will soon be the most sought-after health care lobbyist and consultant in town. There’s not an insurance company around that isn’t struggling with the question she wrestled with for five years: How can Obamacare possibly work?'

analysis,'Justin Sullivan/Getty Images'
analysis,'After months of focusing on how many people have or havent signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, we now have a rough total (7.5 million) and everyones keen to get to the bigger questions: How well is the law working? How many of those who signed up have paid their premiums and are actually getting coverage? How many were uninsured before they signed up? And just how big has the drop been in the number of uninsured people?'
analysis,'Lessons Learned For 2015 From This Years Obamacare Sign-Ups'
analysis,'"Its very challenging," says Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institutes Health Policy Center . "People want answers right away, and the best data sets we have obviously come out with a lag."'
analysis,'Thats partly because of the enormous size and complexity of health system and the law. But its also because the insurance industry is mostly private and regulated by the states.'
analysis,'"The impact that all of these changes are going to have on the marketplace are going to play out differently all across the country," says Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the trade group Americas Health Insurance Plans . "Simply looking at national data doesnt tell you whats going to happen in a particular market in a particular state."'
analysis,'First, how many people have actually paid their premiums for insurance theyve chosen through the health exchange? Thats the final, and arguably, most important part of the sign-up process. Most insurers report numbers in the 80 to 85 percent range . You might assume the people not paying are deadbeats. But thats hardly the case.'
analysis,'"This is not at all surprising," says Ken Jacobs, who heads the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California Berkeley . The labor center just published a study of whos signing up for coverage in California. The research predicts that fully half the people who enroll in a plan through the California health exchange wont keep it for a full year.'
analysis,'With Enrollee Goal Met, Obamacare Still Faces Political Trial'
analysis,'"We have people who are starting in the non-group market and they get a job with job-based coverage and they leave," Jacobs says. "Or their income goes down and they end up going into Medicaid." Meanwhile, some others who have Medicaid experience a boost in income during the year and dont qualify anymore, "so they go into the exchange," Jacobs says, "or they get a job with job-based coverage and they leave the exchange."'
analysis,'In the case of the Affordable Care Act, he says, that transience was multiplied by lots of people who signed up in October and November and December — well before they had to pay their premiums.'
analysis,'Are There Really Fewer Uninsured?'
analysis,'Then theres the question of how the law is affecting people without insurance. But Jacobs says that asking whether people signing up had insurance previously is actually the wrong question — because of that same churning that affects the payment of premiums.'
analysis,'People move in and out of insurance all the time, he says, "and what the new marketplaces do is provide a place where people go rather than becoming uninsured during those times. And so you may have people who had insurance — job-based coverage – [then] lost their job, and now theyre going into one of the marketplaces, rather than becoming uninsured."'
analysis,'One presumes wed begin to get a handle on that when the Census Bureau puts out its annual numbers in the fall . Except officials have decided to change the way they ask their health insurance questions for the Current Population Survey . (Thats the study that produces the annual uninsured number.)'
analysis,'Those tweaks to the survey mean that, going forward, the uninsured numbers wont really be comparable to those of past years. Thats produced some significant upset in the research community.'
analysis,'"It is a very unfortunate set of decisions in my opinion," says Blumberg of the Urban Institute. "We have all used the Current Population Survey for trends for measuring insurance coverage ... forever, it seems like, and were not going to be able to do that because of the question changes."'
analysis,'Eventually, researchers say, the impact of the law will become more clear, as more data become available. But "eventually" is likely to be well after this years elections — and possibly after the presidential contest of 2016.'

facts,'Nicole Yorksmith (left) holds her son while standing with her partner, Pam Yorksmith. They were among four legally married couples who filed a federal civil rights lawsuit seeking to compel Ohio to recognize same-sex marriages on birth certificates.'
facts,'The state of Ohio was told by a federal judge Monday that it must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states, Ohio Public Radio and TVs Jo Ingles reports .'
facts,'The decision follows similar rulings by federal judges in other states and was not a surprise. Judge Timothy Black had said earlier this month that he would soon issue such a ruling.'
facts,'For now at least, Blacks decision applies only to the four couples who brought the case. They want their names on their childrens state-issued birth certificates .'
facts,'"The federal court has stayed the order for everyone except the 4 couples named in this suit," Ingles wrote as she tweeted the decision . The state will argue against expanding the ruling in its appeal of Blacks decision.'
facts,'In his ruling, Black said that "Ohios marriage recognition is facially unconstitutional and unenforceable under any circumstances," The Columbus Dispatch reports .'
facts,'In 2004, Ohio voters approved a ban on same-sex marriages in the state. As WVXU notes , the lawsuit at the center of Judge Blacks ruling "did not seek to allow same-sex partners to get married in Ohio, just the recognition of marriages from other states."'

facts,'The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Monday that it expects the federal deficit will be about $22 billion less this fiscal year than previously thought, and about $9 billion less than had been anticipated next year.'
facts,'"But if current laws do not change," CBO warned, "the period of shrinking deficits will soon come to an end. Between 2015 and 2024, annual budget shortfalls are projected to rise substantially — from a low of $469 billion in 2015 to about $1 trillion from 2022 through 2024 — mainly because of the aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt."'
facts,'Still, CBO also said that while deficits are going to start rising again unless lawmakers act, the increases in those annual shortfalls between revenue and spending will likely be less than it had been predicting as recently as February. It gives the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare as it is known) some of the credit:'
facts,'"The projected cumulative deficit from 2015 through 2024 is $286 billion less than it was in February: Though projected revenues are slightly below the amounts that were previously reported, projected outlays have dropped by more, largely because of lower subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). CBO also projects slightly lower outlays for Medicare, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as Food Stamps), defense, and net interest."'
facts,'Also Monday, CBO said it had not changed its economic projections. It still expects gross domestic product will grow 3.1 percent from the end of 2013 through 2014, and 3.4 percent next year. The unemployment rate may remain relatively high, however. The jobless rate, which stood at 6.7 percent in March , will dip only to 6.3 percent by the end of 2015 if CBOs forecast is correct.'

analysis,'As of this writing, Rep. Vance McAllister is still a Republican congressman representing his northeastern Louisiana district.'
analysis,'And thats part of the problem, according to the Louisiana Republican Party establishment. Gov. Bobby Jindal and state party chairman Roger Villere both recommended publicly and strongly that McAllister immediately resign in the wake of widely seen security video showing the married congressman canoodling a married now-ex-staffer.'
analysis,'As the week ended, with Congress entering its two-week spring break, McAllister was keeping a low public profile, though he did tell the News-Star newspaper of Monroe, La., earlier in the week he didnt plan to resign.'
analysis,'And thats the other part of the problem for the national and state Republican establishment. If McAllister, who won a November special election to get to Congress, doesnt decide to resign, his party is stuck with him. That is at least until the fall election, when voters will have their opportunity to turn him out of office.'
analysis,'While its certainly a scandal for a married congressman to be captured kissing a married aide on a viral video, it certainly doesnt rise to the level of the kind of behavior that has historically caused the House to expel its members.'
analysis,'In fact, only five House members have gotten expelled in the nations history, and three of those expulsions happened during the Civil War for reasons of disloyalty to the United States, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report . Two others, in 1980 and 2002, came after corruption convictions.'
analysis,'McAllister will likely face rising pressure to resign, however. Fundraising should be much harder for him now with the state party establishment firmly against him. State party officials already had reasons to feel tepid about him since he had shown an independent streak. For instance, he opposed Jindals decision to not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act; McAllister represents a district high in poverty.'
analysis,'Meanwhile, his newfound political weakness invites challengers who might have otherwise stayed out of the race.'
analysis,'Congressional Republicans like Speaker John Boehner have been more circumspect. They havent openly called for his resignation, but they also have indicated that they expect much better behavior from members of Congress. They certainly dont appreciate the distraction caused by McAllisters case.'
analysis,'Just because they cant expel him doesnt mean House Republicans cant try to make life more miserable for him in the hope that he resigns, or to signal voters in his district that they might want to have someone else represent them.'
analysis,'For instance, they could strip him of his agriculture and natural resources committee assignments. That could truly sting, since his district is mostly rural.'

analysis,'MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:'
analysis,'And now, we turn to our Friday political commentators - E.J. Dionne, of The Washington Post; and David Brooks, of the New York Times. Welcome back to you both.'
analysis,'DAVID BROOKS: Good to be here.'
analysis,'E.J. DIONNE: Good to be with you.'
analysis,'BLOCK: And David, we just heard President Obama say about the Sebelius resignation, the final score speaks for itself, talking about the 7.5 million or so people who signed up, ultimately, for health insurance. Is that how you see her legacy? Or how overshadowed is that by the botched rollout of healthcare.gov?'
analysis,'BROOKS: Its pretty overshadowed. She definitely leaves under a cloud. Ive never been sure how much to blame her. Theres a lot of passive-aggressive behavior in government. Its very hard for a Cabinet secretary to really run their department. You got to be a super bulldog and she was not that. And they brought in this outside team to actually get some change going there.'
analysis,'I do think, you know, they did recover. I give them all the credit in the world about that. I think the one thing thats been the tragedy of the whole government - the website fiasco is that its distracted attention from what really is the crucial and core issue with the health care, is what about costs?'
analysis,'During the recession, the health care cost inflation was on the way down. Now, its spiking back upward again. And so we - she and the whole success of Obamacare really depends on bending the cost curve, and all the attention has been taken off that; and I think shes part of that problem.'
analysis,'BLOCK: E.J., could you make the case that Kathleen Sebelius really should have resigned when the launch was so badly bungled, take responsibility for that?'
analysis,'DIONNE: I think, actually, that wouldve made things worse at the time. I think the administration didnt want her to resign because it would be a kind of admission of failure. I think theyre much better off that she left now after the good news was in, and Im not sure prices are spiking quite the way David said.'
analysis,'Shes a very interesting person. I mean, when you go back, she led a Democratic era in Kansas. That takes more doing than a Democratic era in Maryland or New York, for example. And she did fight hard, and effectively, to get the Affordable Care Act passed. There was the website disaster for which she bears some responsibility. I agree with David - I want to know someday exactly how this mess happened.'
analysis,'But she gets to go out war-weary, as Scott Horsley rightly said, but having the Affordable Care Act on a pretty good track. So it was a good day for her to leave.'
analysis,'BLOCK: Well, we heard Kathleen Sebelius referring to President Obamas speech yesterday at the LBJ Library in Texas, talking about the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act and in the context of doing that, talking about Medicare, which her father helped to pass. President Obama said in that speech yesterday, the office of the presidency humbles you. And he compared himself to a relay swimmer in the currents of history.'
analysis,'PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: But the presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates, by working within the confines of the world as it is, but also by reimagining the world as it should be.'
analysis,'BLOCK: And E.J., without specifically talking about the health care overhaul, that did seem to be the clear echo that the president was reaching for there.'
analysis,'DIONNE: Right. And I think its fair enough to say that Medicare itself was passed as part of a long democratic effort to get some sort of national health insurance passed. Lyndon Johnson settled for a very expansive program for the elderly, and Medicaid for the poor. And so this is an effort to finish that job. So I think thats legitimate.'
analysis,'There were a lot of comparisons of LBJ and President Obama, and why cant he be the schmoozer and arm-twister that LBJ was; and I think one of the things we forget - we forget a lot of things - but one of them is that LBJ governed in a much more consensual time, when the parties were less polarized. There was much more diversity in each party.'
analysis,'And I was thinking a lot about LBJ this week. His favorite passage in the Bible was from Isaiah: Come let us reason together. That was actually possible in 1964. There really isnt much coming together to reason these days.'
analysis,'BLOCK: David Brooks, your thoughts on the LBJ legacy and in particular, the social safety net and where we are now.'
analysis,'BROOKS: Yeah, Im really struck by the way the president emphasized the limits of the office, and we imagine LBJ as this all-powerful president. But in fact, he was riding social movements. And in some of the reflections on the Civil Rights Act Memorial - I think too much attention has been given to LBJ, and not enough to the movement that created it. Its worth remembering the year before, when Bayard Rustin and Philip Randolph wanted to have a little march on Washington. Most of the major civil rights groups were against it, and they had to fight some real resistance to actually have that march, affected by events in Birmingham. And it was that march, and it was the social movement behind it, that allowed LBJ and the politicians to be the icing on the cake. I think its very hard for a president to really start something that big unless theres a groundswell underneath it.'
analysis,'DIONNE: I just want to second David. I think the social movement was very important, and there hasnt been quite the same kind of social movement behind progressive change in this era.'
analysis,'BLOCK: A question about 2016 presidential politics, if I might. I know its only 2014, but Im going to go there. There does seem to be building Republican buzz around Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, as a presidential contender; and he made some news this week. He was speaking at his fathers presidential library in Texas, and he talked about illegal immigrants crossing the border to provide for their family, or to put food on the table.'
analysis,'JEB BUSH: Yes, they broke the law, but its not a felony. Its kind of a - its an act of love. Its an act of commitment to your family.'
analysis,'BLOCK: David Brooks, are you hearing much enthusiasm for a Jeb Bush candidacy among Republicans?'
analysis,'BROOKS: Not among those earning under a couple million dollars a year. You know, among the donor class, among some of the richer - more moderate, frankly - Republicans, theres an idyllic sense that hed be a good candidate. Most people dont have that, and I assume hes not going to run because hes never shown the desire.'
analysis,'Youve got to have this intense desire to want to traipse around Iowa and New Hampshire and all these states, put your family through it all. James Carville used to joke: Once you have the desire, it never goes away. Its like sex; nobody ever had sex once and said, OK, that was fine, Im done with that.'
analysis,'(LAUGHTER)'
analysis,'BROOKS: Once they get the desire to run for president, they want to do it forever. But if they dont have the desire, they really dont run, and Jeb Bush has never shown that fire to run for office. So until Im proven differently, I assume hes not going to be running for president.'
analysis,'BLOCK: E.J., top that.'
analysis,'DIONNE: Im not going to top that - the Carville comment. But, you know, first of all good for Jeb Bush for speaking that way about immigrants. There was another Bush who spoke that way, and his name was George W., and he got elected; and he got elected because he got 40 percent of the Latino vote.'
analysis,'I think David may be right that Jeb isnt running, but hes making an awful lot of moves that suggest he would like to run, and he is filling a space left by the decline of Chris Christie. A lot of the people who are moving to Jeb, particularly in the donor class, were Christie people.'
analysis,'There is one thing he has, and I think its a problem - that its the past. And running against Hillary Clinton, you know, time for a change so lets have a Clinton-Bush race? Again, that is problematic. But hes got a kind of optimism when he speaks. I heard him speak about a month ago, and the Republican Party these days is very gloomy about the state of the country, about where were going. And at least he speaks optimistically. So I think there are problems with a candidacy, but I think that optimism is something some Republican has to pick up on.'
analysis,'BLOCK: And Jeb Bushs mother, Barbara Bush, has now backed off her comment from last year, where she said weve had enough Bushes. Shes now...'
analysis,'(LAUGHTER)'
analysis,'DIONNE: Thats a real - sort of barrier there.'

facts,'The people who design marketing apps are celebrating a change in the way iBeacon works on iPhones. Thats the Bluetooth-based system that lets a store track a customers movements, and capitalize on them. For instance, if iBeacon detects you lingering in the shoe department, it might send you a digital coupon for socks.'
facts,'IBeacon has been around for a while, and marketers liked the concept in principle. Macys, Major League Baseball and American Eagle Outfitters are just a few of the brands that have experimented with the technology. But there was a big practical problem: It only worked when a customers phone was running the marketers app. Once you closed the app, the tracking stopped.'
facts,'That problem has now been fixed. When Apple updated the iPhones operating system two months ago, it changed it to allow marketing apps to keep tabs on your location even when theyre off. When you close an app, it "deputizes" the phones operating system to keep listening for iBeacon signals on its behalf.'
facts,'The change was heralded last month on the blog BEEKn , run by industry insider Doug Thompson. He says Apple didnt publicize the new system, but when people working on iBeacon marketing products found out about it, they were thrilled.'
facts,'"It was the announcement everybody was waiting for," Thompson says. He says it eliminates the nagging problem of how to get customers to open a location-tracking app in the places where it might be useful.'
facts,'"It was hard enough to get the [customers] to download the app," Thompson says. Getting them to reopen it every time they come back to a place where its useful was just too cumbersome.'
facts,'Of course, the change has others spooked.'
facts,'"As a privacy researcher, I always get nervous when marketers are celebratory about something," says Garrett Cobarr, a technologist and writer based in Seattle. He says Apple seems to ignore certain assumptions that people make about whats happening on a device.'
facts,'Stores Are Snooping Into Your Smartphone'
facts,'"Most users if you asked them would assume that if the app wasnt on, it wasnt being used," Cobarr says. He says finding out a closed app can still track the phones location "would surprise most people and perhaps unnerve them."'
facts,'For Apples part, the iBeacon explainer separates the company from the third-party apps that take advantage of this technology: "If you allow third-party apps or websites to use your current location, you agree to their terms, privacy policies, and practices," Apple writes.'
facts,'If iBeacon tracking unnerves you, there are still ways to turn it off. The simplest is to shut off the Bluetooth function on your phone. You could also go into settings and restrict a particular marketing apps access to location services ... or you could simply delete the app altogether.'
