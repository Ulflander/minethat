Hello fellow redditors,

I just released a landing page for a project I develop since a few months. I'm now gathering some feedback about this landing page, and I obviously thought about r/startups!

Would you mind to give me your feedback if you have any? Here is the landing page: [minethat.co](http://www.minethat.co?r=r1).

For your pain, or for free :), here are some resources I read (and appreciated) while making this landing page:

* http://www.goodui.org/ - General advices about UI and landing pages
* http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/ - Principles of User Interface Design
* http://99designs.com/designer-blog/2014/01/15/7-unbreakable-laws-of-user-interface-design/ - 7 unbreakable laws of user interface design
* http://www.spikelab.org/blog/why-doing-a-startup-golden-circle.html - A story about purpose-driven business

As we're here, I'm also in the process to find a cofounder for this project, if by any chance you're interested, contact me!

Thanks for your time!
