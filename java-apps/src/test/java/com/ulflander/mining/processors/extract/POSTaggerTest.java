At some point after that declaration, the local mayor and police agreed to cede the city’s administrative headquarters once again to the separatists, who were busy Friday making molotov cocktails in the basement of City Hall.\n" +

                "It was not immediately clear why the local government caved, but the development appeared to illustrate the challenges that Kiev faces in trying to regain control in eastern Ukraine.\n" +

                "“Without batting an eye, our Western partners keep demanding day after day that Russia stop interfering in Ukrainian affairs, pull out troops and remove certain agents who have reportedly been caught in the southeast and who are reportedly guiding these processes,” Lavrov said at a forum of young Russian diplomats.\n" +

                "Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian actions, and his top deputies said a Ukrainian mobilization in the restive eastern part of the country would elicit a Russian response. The tit-for-tat military movements brought the two sides closer to a direct armed confrontation in a standoff that analysts call one of the most dangerous on European soil since the end of the Cold War.\n" +

                "\"We suspect there will be a very large archaeological deposit from the labor camp,\" Jones said. \"It's somewhere inside Jasper Ridge. We have to be careful while we're looking for it, because there are poison oak plants, ticks and rattlesnakes. Archaeology is a field science and there are hazards. It's a good thing to teach students. I'm the only one that's been bitten by a tick yet this year.\"\n" +

When Jones was in grade school, her family moved to Iowa City, where her father taught education at the University of Iowa.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Growing up in rural states, I was certainly aware of dirt – of soil,\" she said. \"I had a foot in academia and in the outdoors. I enjoyed the seasons and working with my hands. My grandmother canned, tatted, knitted and quilted, so I had the sense there was a kind of dignity in that work. My family also was very interested in South Carolina history.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "After earning a bachelor's degree in anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, Jones headed north to Stanford, where she earned a master's degree (1985) and a doctorate (1991) in material culture and applied anthropology studies.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Soon, she was working for the Ohlone Tribe, which was excavating hundreds of bodies of tribal members discovered near construction sites in San Jose and Milpitas to be reburied.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"It was really an important moment in Native American cemetery protection, because the tribe insisted that they be in charge of handling the human remains and caring for the graves,\" Jones said. \"I was their employee. Traditionally, it had been the other way around. Archaeologists would hire Native Americans to observe cemetery work. So I trained Native Americans in excavation techniques. Descendents of the Ohlone Tribe excavated all of the bodies. I was there to support their work – I wrote reports and attended meetings – and served as the liaison with the landowners.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In 1994, when Stanford was looking for a campus archaeologist, Jones didn't bother applying for the job, because she'd been rejected for the same post three years earlier for being \"unsupervisable.\" This time, Stanford called her, and hired her part-time under a six-month probation to work on the Sand Hill Road expansion project.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"At the end of six months, they decided I was agreeable enough to stay, and they offered to make me a full-time campus archaeologist if I would take on historic preservation as well,\" Jones said. \"So in 1995, I took charge of the Loma Prieta Earthquake Recovery Projects funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "She handled the negotiations with county, state and federal officials as Stanford set about repairing, restoring or renovating buildings damaged in the 1989 earthquake, including the Stanford Museum, which reopened in 1999 as the Cantor Arts Center; Green Library; Hanna House, a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece; and several buildings on the Main Quad.\n" +

Blue Award, the program staff of the Native American Cultural Center (Karen Biestman, associate dean and director; Denni Woodward, assistant director; and Greg Graves, graduate recruitment and retention coordinator), wrote that Jones has left a \"deep and widespread footprint\" at Stanford that began when she was in graduate school.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A year before the passage of the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, leaders from the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe appealed to the university to repatriate 550 skeletal remains of their ancestors. Jones, working with Stanford's archaeologist, was central to those discussions. When Stanford decided to repatriate the remains, Jones personally delivered the Ohlone ancestors to the Coyote Hills in Fremont for reburial.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"This event was groundbreaking on many fronts,\" they wrote. \"In fact, it earned her much criticism from museum professionals and archaeology peers across the country that feared Stanford's action would signal the removal of osteological research materials from teaching collection shelves. In the end, not only were their concerns unfounded, but also it became apparent it was the right thing to do. The decision earned Stanford a reputation for setting a high ethical standard in the discipline, and earned Laura a reputation as an innovative professional, and trusted tribal and Native Community partner – all of which persist today.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Describing Jones as \"a champion of all things Stanford,\" they cited her work overseeing the excavation of the Men's Gymnasium, the repair of the Angel of Grief historic memorial and the restoration of the Arizona Cactus Garden near the Stanford Family Mausoleum.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Currently, Jones reviews historic preservation issues for faculty/staff housing and leased properties, including the Research Park, Webb Ranch and the Palo Alto Train Depot. Her job is to identify Stanford's historical assets and analyze their historic importance.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Stanford has a value, which is we should preserve archaeological sites and historic buildings,\" she said. \"But we also have a goal, which is preserving our leadership as a world-class university. To achieve that goal we want to build a new hospital, to build a new chemistry building or to be better stewards of the creek. It's my role to see that we respect important archaeological and historic sites and that our stewardship of those sites is rewarded when we get permits for our construction projects. I work in Stanford's Land, Buildings and Real Estate organization, and we're really in the business of getting permission for the university to do things. I work on getting that permission.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For instance, Jones said, Stanford had to ask for – and won – permission from Santa Clara County to gut the Old Chemistry Building and transform it into a center devoted to undergraduate science education. The design will incorporate some of the building's key historic features, including its cast-iron stairs, wood wainscot and trim. The rest of the building will be transformed, with a library, auditorium, classrooms and laboratories.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Part of my role is to show that we've thought about the historic issues related to the Old Chemistry Building and have presented a thoughtful response about remodeling it,\" she said. \"Our preservation approach to Old Chem is that you should know you're in a building that was built in 1903 and that was remodeled in 2014 – a place where you will be able to see both the old and the modern at the same time.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Jones said her favorite excavation was the Stanford Family Mansion, which collapsed during the 1906 earthquake, was demolished to the basement and covered with a lawn.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Every spring for about six years, I would take a class out there, and we would dig up the basement,\" she said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "One of the treasures they unearthed was Jane Stanford's ceramic pink and white toilet set – a pitcher, bowl, sponge tray and footbath. All told, the family mementos filled 75 boxes.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"It was huuugely fun, because it connected students to Stanford's history, and because they found treasure every day,\" Jones said. \"In archaeology, there is usually a lot of sifting of dirt and then a few tiny clues. But the mansion's basement was full of treasures. You couldn't plan it better as an archaeology class.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "An awards ceremony will be held on Wednesday, May 21, at 3:30 p.m. in Lagunita Courtyard to honor Jones and this year's other Amy J.

                "Mykola P. Romanchuk, the governor of the Mykolaiv region, praised the effort at dialogue. “The right way to solve any problems — economic, judicial and, today, political,” Mr. Romanchuk said, “we need to solve at the round table.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The atmosphere was notably lighter than at the previous session in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where officials from the embattled region at times openly questioned the motives and even the legitimacy of the provisional government.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Officials described Sunday’s presidential election as critical to Ukraine’s moving forward after the recent months of unrest. The acting prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, said the government was working steadily to carry out a series of structural changes, including constitutional amendments, and a decentralization plan that will give greater budget authority to local officials.\n" +

                "Mr. Yatsenyuk said the government was also committed to tightening ties with Europe through formal political and trade agreements. “We have no other way,” he said. Mr. Yatsenyuk also sounded optimistic about the east, collectively known as Donbass, where he said separatist groups were clearly weakened.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“In the last few days, the situation in Donbass has turned around,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said. “The self-proclaimed Donbass republics will control neither Donbass nor Ukraine. I can call it an achievement of our common efforts.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In a visit to a military base located near the city of Slovyansk, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, Ukraine’s acting president, told local news media that Kiev’s military campaign against the rebel groups was entering its “final phase” and vowed to “cleanse the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of terrorists.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Denis Pushilin, the speaker for the revolutionary republic’s parliament based in Donetsk, denounced the military campaign and said that if it continued it could provoke a military response from Russia.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Speaking in his office on the 10th floor of the seized regional administration building in Donetsk, Mr. Pushilin on Wednesday denied any rift between himself and Mr. Ponomaryov.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "He said that Mr. Ponomaryov had received “incorrect information” because the military blockade of the city had hampered communications, which could be monitored by the Ukrainian military.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "But Mr. Pushilin said that relations remained strong with Mr. Strelkov, who he said controlled all the paramilitary groups in the region.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Ukrainian media outlets, many of them openly hostile to anti-Kiev forces in the east, have reported that heightened tensions have led to arguments and even armed clashes among rebel commanders in several cities.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Both Mr. Pushilin and Mr. Ponomaryov denied that serious fighting had taken place.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "On Tuesday, several military trucks with armed men bearing a Russian flag sped into Donetsk from the north and surrounded the headquarters of the Ukrainian Security Service, which has been occupied by members of a Donetsk-based militia.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Sentries dressed in military fatigues and armed with automatic rifles were posted at crossroads leading to the building, and city police officers prevented pedestrians from entering the area.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A guard, who did not give his name but identified himself as a second lieutenant in the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, said they had come from the city of Horlivka, which is located to the north of Donetsk, in order to “instill order” among members of a local militia.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“There is no discipline” among them, he said, adding that the local militias were “unprofessional” and had not been registered. “Horlivka made the revolution.”\n" +
