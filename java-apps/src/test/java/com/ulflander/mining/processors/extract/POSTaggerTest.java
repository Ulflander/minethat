            "By William Booth and Michael Birnbaum, The Washington Post\n"+
            "Updated: Friday, April 25, 3:25 PM\n"+
            "DONETSK, Ukraine — The Ukrainian government Friday brushed off Russian threats of intervention in a tense standoff in eastern Ukraine, declaring that Ukraine’s “anti-terrorist operation” against pro-Russian militiamen occupying government buildings would continue.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "Ukrainian troops clashed with pro-Russian militants at barricades and checkpoints Thursday in eastern Ukraine, with fighting centered around the breakaway city of Slovyansk, a separatist stronghold.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“We do not want any casualties. We will not storm the city. We realize that there may be a large number of injured people in this case,” said Vasyl Krutov, deputy chief of Ukraine’s Security Service, at a news briefing in Kiev on Friday.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Friday that Ukraine’s military move -- called ATO, for Anti-Terrorist Operation — would continue.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“There’s been no suspension of the ATO in the face of threats from an invasion by Russian armed forces,” Avakov said.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "The Ukrainian interior minister said, “The terrorists should be on their guard around the clock. Civilians have nothing to fear.”\n"+
            "\n"+
            "German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russian President Vladi­mir Putin on Friday to discuss the tense situation in Ukraine, Merkel’s spokesman and the Kremlin said.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "The Russian leader appeared to give no ground in his insistance that the interim government in Kiev back down against pro-Russian separatists who have seized several cities in eastern Ukraine.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“Putin harshly condemned the attempts of the regime in Kiev to use armed forces against peaceful civilians in the southeast of the country,” the Kremlin said in a statement.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "But there were few signs of open conflict Friday in or around the contested eastern cities.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "In Mariupol, a southeastern Ukrainian port city on the Sea of Azov, control of the local government was back in the hands of the separatist People’s Republic of Donetsk on Friday, a day after Kiev proclaimed the City Hall there liberated from pro-Russian militiamen. At some point after that declaration, the local mayor and police agreed to cede the city’s administrative headquarters once again to the separatists, who were busy Friday making molotov cocktails in the basement of City Hall.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "It was not immediately clear why the local government caved, but the development appeared to illustrate the challenges that Kiev faces in trying to regain control in eastern Ukraine.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Friday that the West wants to take control of Ukraine and is obsessed by its geopolitical ambitions.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“Without batting an eye, our Western partners keep demanding day after day that Russia stop interfering in Ukrainian affairs, pull out troops and remove certain agents who have reportedly been caught in the southeast and who are reportedly guiding these processes,” Lavrov said at a forum of young Russian diplomats.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "On Thursday night, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said that Russia “has refused to take a single step in the right direction.”\n"+
            "\n"+
            "Kerry said the U.S. government was preparing another round of economic sanctions aimed at constraining Russian ambitions in Ukraine.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“I have told John Kerry many times — he raised the question about two weeks ago — that they should show Russian agents, if they have really been caught by the Ukrainian services, to people; they should show them on TV,” Lavrov said.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "He spoke a day after Russia began military drills on its border with Ukraine in response to Ukrainian military operations that killed “up to five” pro-Russian militants, according to Ukrainian officials.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the Ukrainian actions, and his top deputies said a Ukrainian mobilization in the restive eastern part of the country would elicit a Russian response. The tit-for-tat military movements brought the two sides closer to a direct armed confrontation in a standoff that analysts call one of the most dangerous on European soil since the end of the Cold War.\n"+
            "\n"+
            "“If the Kiev regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country, it beyond any doubt is a very serious crime,” Putin said at a media forum in St. Petersburg. He added that if Ukrainian authorities escalated the confrontation, there would be “consequences.”\n"+
            "\n"+
            "After a day of increasingly dire reports from the ground, the Obama administration struck back, at least verbally. “If Russia continues in this direction, it will not just be a grave mistake, it will be an expensive mistake,” Kerry said in Washington. Although he announced no new sanctions, Kerry said, “The window [for Russia] to change course is closing. . . . We are ready to act.”");
