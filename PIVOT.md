Wait a minute. What happened roughly:

204 Million emails
2.46 Million Facebook posts
320,000 Tweets
54,000 Tumblr posts
17 New Wikipedia articles
1,500 blog posts

I have a mission: make sense of all this information,
then extract the worthy 1% to read.


1. Find the top bloggers in your niche or industry
2. Subscribe to their email alerts or RSS feeds
3. Read them over several weeks
4. Get a sense for what interests them and their own voice
5. Send them useful links that have nothing to do with your business
6. When it comes time to invite them to a press call or embargo or get a press release you aren't a stranger, you reference them personally and they are more likely to be interested in you
